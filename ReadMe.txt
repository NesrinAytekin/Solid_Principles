SOLID Prencibles:

SOLID is an acronym for 5 important design principles when doing OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
-These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.
-The actual SOLID acronym was, however, identified later by Michael Feathers.

	(S) - Single-Responsiblity Principle :A class should have only a single responsibility.
	(O) - Open-Closed Principle:Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
	(L) - Liskov Substitution Principle:Objects in aprogram should be repleceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
	(I) - Interface Segregation Principle:Many client-spesific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
	(D) - Dependency Inversion Principle:Use lots of interfaces and abstractions.

-These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
